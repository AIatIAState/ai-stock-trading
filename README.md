What: Although LLMs have many applications, using them for stock and crypto trading often relies on paid subscription platforms built on closed-source models (e.g., https://quant.drnamlabs.com/). In this work, we aim to evaluate and improve open-source LLMs for trading-related tasks. Our project has two phases: (1) building a historical trading dataset, and (2) integrating LLM techniques—such as fine-tuning and preference optimization—into a platform that can automatically suggest trading actions and summarize current market conditions.

Users: small businesses, students.

Features: - View market condition.
- Seeing status or each ticket.
- Perform virtual trade (note, the application of this work is for simulating the market. No actual funding investment is performed in the application).
- Showing percentage of winning trade.

UseCases: A person who do trading for stock/ crypto
A student who wants to learn more about stocking and finance.

Example: John wants to do trading but he didn't know about what types of stock he can make profit from investment.
